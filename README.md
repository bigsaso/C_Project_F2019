# Term Project for Fall 2019 Intro to C course
This repo contains the term project for the intro to C programming course. It consists of taking data of Canadian lakes temperatures from 2018-2019 and analyzing them.
This project was done in a team of three with two fellow students from Ryerson University.

**Question 1** asked for the 2019 yearly average of each lake and for all the lakes put together.

**Question 2** consists of two parts. The first part asks the user to indicate the coldest lake and the warmest lake based on the yearly average. The second part then states which lakes are above or below overall average.

**Question 3** asks the user to indicate the day and the temperature for the warmest and coldest water temperatures for each of the lakes.

**Question 4** was about finding the warmest and coldest water overall and specifying the exact date(s) in which those temperatures were registered.

**Question 5** was about finding the summer average of all lakes and displaying it in order from warmest to coldest.

**Question 6** was about finding the winter average of all lakes and displaying it in order from warmest to coldest.

**Question 7** asked about the number of days you can comfortably swim in the 6 lakes.

**Question 8** asked about the number of days that the lake is frozen.

**Question 9** asked for the 2018 yearly average of each lake and for all the lakes put together and asked for a table that illustrated the 2019 and 2018 averages side by side.
